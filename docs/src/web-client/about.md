# WebClient

TypeScript library, which can be used to programmatically interact with the Miden rollup.

The Miden WebClient can be used for a variety of things, including:

* Deploying and creating transactions to interact with accounts and notes on Miden.
* Storing the state of accounts and notes in the browser.
* Generating and submitting proofs of transactions.
* Submitting transactions to delegated proving services.

This section of the docs is an overview of the different things one can achieve using the WebClient, and how to implement them. 

Keep in mind that both the WebClient and the documentation are works-in-progress!
